The final project of this course is designed to allow each of you to show off what you've learned. The final project consists of creating a webpage on a subject of your choosing. There is no minimum or maximum number of webpages and there are no required code elements (HTML, Javascript, Cascading Style Sheets). That said, it will be really hard to convince me that you have mastered the material of the course if no webpages exist.

Think of something that you would like to create a webpage about and create that webpage. Design a site that gets the information you want across and does it in a visually appealing way. Some good projects you can do.

A music site - This will teach you how to work with JS players.
